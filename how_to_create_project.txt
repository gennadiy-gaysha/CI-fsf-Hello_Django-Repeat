1. Create project directory and move to it.

2. Before creating a Django project, it's a good practice to create a virtual
environment for it. This isolates your project's dependencies from the system-wide
Python installation.
python -m venv venv_name

3. Activate the virtual environment (on Windows):
venv_name\Scripts\activate

4. While your virtual environment is active, install Django using pip. You don't
need to install Django globally on your system.
pip install Django

5. Once you're in the desired directory, you can create your Django project using
the django-admin startproject command followed by the project name. For example,
if you want to name your project movie_proj, you can run:
django-admin startproject movie_proj .
!!! The . at the end indicates that the project should be created in the current
directory. This will create a movie_proj directory with the initial project files.

6. If you need additional packages for your project, you can install them while your
virtual environment is active.
pip install package_name_1 package_name_2 package_name_3 package_name_4

6`. After installing all packages create requirements.txt file
pip freeze > requirements.txt

To hide sensitive data, such as the Django secret key, in a Django project using
the dotenv library, you can follow these steps:

- Install python-dotenv dj_database_url and psycopg2:
pip install python-dotenv
pip install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2 (we use psycopg2 to connect to
PostgreSQL)
- Create a .env File: Create a file named .env in the root directory of your
Django project. This is where you'll store your sensitive data.
- Place your SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL value in it:
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkeyhere
DATABASE_URL=mydatabaseurl
- Access Environment Variables in Settings: Open your Django project's settings.py
file and import the dotenv library:
import dotenv
import dj_database_url (for remote database)
- Load Environment Variables: At the top of your settings.py file, load the
environment variables from the .env file:
dotenv.load_dotenv()
- Access Environment Variables: Use the os.environ dictionary to access the
environment variables from the .env file. For example, to access the secret key:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
to access remote database (!replace the local database with a remote database):
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
- Replace 'SECRET_KEY' with the actual name of the environment variable you
defined in your .env file (if needed)
- Git Ignore .env: It's crucial to add .env to your .gitignore file so that you
don't accidentally commit sensitive data to version control.
also add venv directory and local db to .gitignore:
.env
venv/
db.sqlite3
-Use .env in Production: In production environments, you can manually set environment
variables using the server's configuration or a service like Heroku's config vars.

6``. Create your app:
python manage.py startapp movie_app

6```. Add newly created app to the end of INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings
.py file:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
...,
'todo'
]

6````. To ensure that the database schema is up to date and ready to
accommodate any models you define in the future:
python manage.py migrate

7. While the virtual environment is active, you can work on your Django project, run
migrations, start the development server, etc.

8. When you're done working on your project, deactivate the virtual environment.
deactivate
!!! PyCharm provides an option to automatically activate the virtual environment
associated with a project whenever you open a terminal within the IDE.
File>Settings>Tools>Terminal>Activate virtualenv (check/uncheck)

9. Whenever you want to continue working on your project, activate the virtual
environment first.
venv_name\Scripts\activate
